<h2>    Introduction</h2>
This script allows you to combine a large directory of Word documents into a single document.
<h2>    Reason</h2>
We frequently encounter situations where we need to merge multiple Word documents together. While Microsoft Word does offer a feature for this purpose, it can be tedious and unreliable, especially when dealing with a large number of documents. To address this issue, I created a script that offers a more efficient and reliable solution. Although this project was not a high priority, I completed it as a side project to gain practice and provide a more convenient option.
<h2>    How it works</h2>
<ul>
<li>    The script takes a large directory of Word documents as input.</li>
<li>    It iterates through each document in the directory and extracts their content.</li>
<li>    The script then combines the extracted content into a single Word document.</li>
<li>    The resulting document contains the combined content of all the input documents, providing a consolidated view of the information.</li>
</ul>
